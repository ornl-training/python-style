A code linter tool is a static code analysis program that automatically checks source code for errors, bugs, stylistic issues, and deviations from coding standards, all without executing the code. Linters help developers catch problems early by flagging questionable constructs, possible vulnerabilities, or code that doesn't follow best practices.

[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is a highly performant linter specifically for Python code. It checks for errors, style issues, and deviations from best practices, and can automatically fix some issues. It is a direct replacement for tools like Flake8, isort, pydocstyle, pyupgrade, and autoflake. Ruff is rapidly becoming the standard Python linting choice due to its speed, breadth of features, and ease of integration. Consequently, Ruff is used in this episode to demonstrate various linting features for Python code.
