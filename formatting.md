A code formatter is a tool that automatically reformats source code according to a set of predefined style guidelines, ensuring consistency in indentation, line breaks, spacing, and other structural aspects of code. The primary goal is to enhance readability, maintain uniform code style across a project, and reduce the need for manual formatting by developers.

[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), originally known as a Python linter, also includes code formatting capabilities, allowing it to apply automatic style adjustments to Python source code. This means Ruff can handle both code linting (error and code quality checks) and code formatting (enforcing a consistent style), much like specialized Python formatters such as [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable). Ruffâ€™s formatter is designed to work very quickly due to its Rust implementation, making it efficient for large projects and continuous integration (CI) workflows.
